<h1>Find.Music</h1>
<p>Find.Music is an application that integrates the Genius lyrics API to search for music recommendations based on a user's track query.</p>
<h2>How it works.</h2>
<p>Find.Music uses HTML, CSS and JavaScript only. The app gets user input from the search bar, encodes the url and uses JavaScript 'fetch' to pass the url to the Genius API. The app sends two fetch requests, the first one searches for the song using the input string, returns the data in JSON format where the app decodes the object sent back, extracts the song ID from the object and uses this song ID to add to the second URL which is then used to fetch for recommendations from the Genius API!</p>
